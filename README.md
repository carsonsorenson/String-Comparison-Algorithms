### This program was written in Python 3.6 for CS5050, Advanced Algorithms.

* There are two functions in `main()` that call either the test cases, or run the empirical stuides.
* The results of the test cases can be found in the file 'trace.txt'. Each algorithm yielded the same results so they work as expected.
* The graphs comparing each algorithm under each test case can be found in the './graphs' directory
* The raw data is found in the './data' directory
* The Shakespeare and DNA text files are located in the './input' directory
